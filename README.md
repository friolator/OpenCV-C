# OpenCV-C
OpenCV-C is a Plain C API for Open CV. 

The purpose of this API is to allow programming environments such as Xojo the ability to use modern
versions of OpenCV. Previously the only way to do this was with OpenCVX, which was limited to 32bit
OpenCV. 

The initial release was commissioned by Gamma Ray Digital, Inc. (http://www.gammaraydigital.com) and 
has been released under the Apache 2.0 license.
